SurviveTomorrow is a 3D survival game where the player needs to survive while also tackling obstacles, which are a consequence of harsh climate.

## Motivation
The Climate Clock is a countdown based on scientific prediction: If we cannot reduce carbon emissions by half and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius within the time stipulated on the clock, climate change will become irreversible. scientists have sufficient evidence to conclude that the effects of climate change could lead to rapid deterioration and dreadful conditions within thirty years and that planet earth could eventually become inhospitable for human life. To create urgency and break the delusion surrounding climate change, we present SurviveTomorrow, a 3D survival game that addresses SDG 13: Climate Action, based on detailed predictions made by climate scientists.

## Plot
This game is set in the near future, about 30 years from now, where the climate clock has dropped to 0 and beyond, and it is impossible to reverse climate change. Survival on Earth since then has become very difficult due to climate change. Polar caps have melted and raised the sea level to a point where hardly any area remains dry. The scorching Sun has led to forest fires and the gradual destruction of crops. Frequent acid rains have demolished buildings and corroded them. Consequently, riots broke out, and a significant slice of the population of the planet began to starve. The social and economic effects of climate change are no less depressing. Resources are limited, and hence there is widespread discontent and warfare. The economic divide is worse than ever, and the very few wealthy and lucky have managed to make it off the planet to primitive settlements on other planets. The loss of human life due to rampant disasters and diseases is astounding. The player is one of the few humans still alive and must survive on the planet until he can find a way to summon a shuttle to take him to a space settlement. He needs to power up the beacon and call the shuttle orbiting the Earth. He must find limited resources like food and water, where each resource represents a level, while surviving the harsh obstacles such as depleting oxygen, acid rain, toxic atmosphere and infected humans.

## Mechanics
The player needs to gather drinkable water and food before he can find the power source to activate the beacon. Obstacles such as acid rain, toxic air, corroded propane tanks and infected humans can cause damage to his health and hence should be avoided. The acid rains are frequent in the environment and can cause moderate amounts of damage to the player’s health. The toxic air in the atmosphere constantly decreases the oxygen level in the player. So the player must find an oxygen tank to recover. Infected humans are constantly moving around the area, and if caught, the infected human can cause damage to the player’s health. The infected human can move towards the character if too close to attack and hence must be evaded by the player. At last, if the player wanders too close to the propane tanks, the unstable tanks can explode and cause significant health damage. In essence, the character’s life can be terminated if either his oxygen level is depleted or his health is empty. On collecting water or food, which are a part of the main objectives, the player’s health can be restored.
